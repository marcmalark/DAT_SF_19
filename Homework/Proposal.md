# Project Proposal


## What is the question you hope to answer? 
Currently, the domain lookup failures in Cisco Security data are not categorized or used extensively to determine possible security threats. Could these be analyzed to identify potential security threats?

## What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
Failure type of domain lookup failures. I need to talk with the data owner about how best to share the project results and what might be possible here.

## What do you know about the data so far? Why did you choose this topic?
Domain lookups can return successful or they can fail. Failures can be a result of typos, random domain name generation, etc. If these failures can be categorized by failure type, it can provide insight to the security experts. With this information they can more accurately detect anomolies that may be security threats. Additionally, if these failure types can be associated with certain domains, they can be targeted for increased monitoring.
